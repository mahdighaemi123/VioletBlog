        # New hope
        When I experience new things I find new hope to live

        Arent you same as me? when you see a new movie, create a new thing or learn a new thing you become the happiest
        person on earth. Also, it is very hopeful when this happens because you learn there is beauty in the Word and
        you didn't know it so should more beauty exist in the Word.
