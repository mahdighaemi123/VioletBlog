        # loneliness
        Strange feeling wich is not letning you be alone

        When i was kid i was asking my self is it wrong to be alone and do what ever i want with my life? Afte some time
        beeing alone, a strange felling came to me with name of loneliness, I found life meaning less and with out any
        color. it is realy painfull, everything became black and white, pain and sorrow. Then i relized everyone need a
        good freand, a good family and a true love to be trauly alive :)
