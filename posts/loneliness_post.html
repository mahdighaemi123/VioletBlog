        # loneliness
        The strange feeling is not letting you be alone

        When I was a kid I asked myself if it was wrong to be alone and do whatever I wanted with my life. After some
        time being alone, a strange feeling came to me with the name of loneliness, I found life meaning less and
        without any color. it is really painful, everything became black and white, pain and sorrow. Then I realized
        everyone needs a good friend, a good family, and true love to be truly alive :)
